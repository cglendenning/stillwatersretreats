  "section1_heading": "How Can I Launch This Thing When I Can’t Even Focus for Five Minutes?!",
  "section1_content": "I need time away to build. You’re ready to launch. The vision is clear, the plan is mapped out, and the finish line is within sight. But every time you sit down to focus, the world seems to conspire against you. The notifications, the noise, the interruptions—they all pile up until even five minutes of uninterrupted focus feels impossible. And without focus, how can you build? How can you execute the launch that your hard work deserves? It’s not a lack of motivation or effort holding you back—it’s your environment. Right now, you don’t just need more time. You need time away. A space where distractions don’t exist, and your mind can settle into the deep focus required to make your vision a reality.",
  "section2_heading": "Why Building Feels Impossible Right Now",
  "section2_content": "For builders like you—creatives, entrepreneurs, coders, writers, and product makers—focus is the foundation of progress. It’s how ideas are refined, plans are executed, and goals are achieved. But focus can’t thrive in chaos. When your environment is filled with noise, interruptions, and mental clutter, your ability to focus is chipped away piece by piece. And instead of moving closer to your launch, you’re stuck spinning your wheels. To build, you need more than just effort. You need an environment that clears the path for uninterrupted, productive work.",
  "section3_heading": "Why Builders Like You Need a Retreat",
  "section3_content": "You’re not just trying to finish a to-do list. You’re building something meaningful—something that requires your full attention, energy, and creativity. But when your environment is working against you, even the most ambitious builders can’t thrive. A retreat isn’t just about escaping the noise. It’s about stepping into a space that amplifies your focus, sharpens your clarity, and supports your ability to build something extraordinary.",
  "section4_heading": "Why a Cabin in the Mountains?",
  "section4_content": "Imagine this: a secluded cabin, surrounded by the stillness of the mountains. No notifications. No interruptions. Just the quiet hum of nature and the freedom to focus fully on what matters. In this space, the noise fades. Your thoughts align. And the work that once felt impossible starts to flow naturally, with clarity and ease. This isn’t just about finding peace—it’s about creating the perfect conditions to build and launch your next big thing.",
  "section5_heading": "Why I Built This Retreat",
  "section5_content": "Hi, I’m Craig. I’m a tech professional and an AirBnB superhost with over 300 5-star reviews. I’ve spent years working in high-stakes environments where focus and flow weren’t just helpful—they were essential. I know how it feels to be stuck, trying to build in an environment that constantly pulls your attention away. I’ve experienced the frustration of knowing what needs to be done but being unable to find the space to do it. And I know how transformational it is to step into a space that clears the distractions and lets you focus fully on your work. That’s why I built this retreat. This isn’t just a cabin. It’s a sanctuary for builders like you—creators, visionaries, and problem-solvers—who need the time and space to think deeply, work productively, and build without interruptions.",

It’s your opportunity to step away, build deeply, and launch with confidence.",
