  "section1_heading": "Why Can’t I Finish This?!",
  "section1_content": "I need space to plan, think, and execute. You’re so close, but something keeps getting in the way. The idea is there. The vision is clear. You know exactly what needs to be done to move forward, and yet, you’re stuck. Every time you sit down to make progress, distractions creep in. The chaos of your environment scatters your focus, and what should be a clear path forward feels impossibly blocked. It’s not that you’re incapable or unmotivated. The truth is, your environment isn’t giving you the space you need to plan, think, and execute. You’re trying to create in the middle of noise, interruptions, and mental clutter—and it’s not working. What you need isn’t more time or effort. What you need is space.",
  "section2_heading": "Why Finishing Feels So Hard",
  "section2_content": "For builders like you—whether you’re writing, coding, designing, or problem-solving—finishing isn’t about just putting in the hours. It’s about aligning your focus, your energy, and your ideas into a state of flow. But when your environment pulls your attention in every direction, that alignment becomes impossible. Your mind stays scattered. Your ideas don’t connect. And the momentum you need to finish slips further out of reach. To plan, think, and execute effectively, you need an environment that supports clarity and focus—not one that fights against it.",
  "section3_heading": "Why Builders Like You Need a Retreat",
  "section3_content": "You’re not just working on a project. You’re building something meaningful—something that requires your full creativity, attention, and execution. But even the most driven builders can’t finish in an environment filled with noise, distractions, and chaos. A retreat isn’t just about stepping away from the noise. It’s about stepping into a space that clears your mind, focuses your energy, and gives you the clarity to plan, think, and execute without interruption.",
  "section4_heading": "Why a Cabin in the Mountains?",
  "section4_content": "Imagine this: a quiet cabin surrounded by the stillness of the mountains. There’s no noise, no interruptions—just the peaceful hum of nature and the space to focus completely on what matters. In this environment, everything shifts. The noise fades away. Your thoughts align. You have the clarity to plan, the focus to think, and the freedom to execute without anything pulling you off track. This isn’t just an escape. It’s a solution—an environment designed to help you finish what you’ve started.",
  "section5_heading": "Why I Built This Retreat",
  "section5_content": "Hi, I’m Craig. I’m a tech professional and an AirBnB superhost with over 300 5-star reviews. I’ve spent years working in high-pressure environments where focus and flow weren’t optional—they were essential. I know the frustration of being stuck in the middle of a project, unable to finish because the environment around you doesn’t support the work. I know what it feels like to have your focus scattered and your progress blocked. And I know how powerful it is to step into a space where everything—your time, your energy, your environment—is aligned to help you finish. That’s why I built this retreat. This isn’t just a cabin. It’s a sanctuary for builders like you—creators, problem-solvers, and visionaries—who need the time and space to plan, think, and execute without distractions.",
  "section6_heading": "Ready to Finish What You Started?",
  "section6_content": "Think about how much energy you’ve spent trying to push through distractions. How many projects have stalled because your environment wasn’t supporting you. How much progress is waiting for you on the other side of a focused, quiet space. Now imagine stepping into a place where the noise is gone, your mind is clear, and your work flows effortlessly from plan to execution. This isn’t just a retreat. It’s your chance to finish what matters most.",
