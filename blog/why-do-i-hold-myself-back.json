  "section1_heading": "Why Do I Hold Myself Back?!",
  "section1_content": "I need to give myself permission to go to the mountains and do deep work. You’ve felt it, haven’t you? That nagging pull to step away, to create space for the work that truly matters. To leave the noise and clutter behind and focus deeply on the things that inspire you. But then the doubt creeps in. “Can I really afford to step away right now?” “What if I fall behind?” “Shouldn’t I just push through?” And so, you stay. You hold yourself back. You try to force progress in an environment that’s actively working against you. But here’s the truth: the work you care about deserves better. You deserve better.",
  "section2_heading": "Why You Need to Give Yourself Permission",
  "section2_content": "The kind of work you do—the kind that requires focus, creativity, and vision—can’t thrive in chaos. When your environment is full of noise, distractions, and demands, it’s not just inconvenient. It’s holding you back from creating what you know you’re capable of. Deep work isn’t about grinding harder. It’s about creating the conditions that allow you to think clearly, focus fully, and unlock your best ideas. And sometimes, that means stepping away. Giving yourself permission to retreat isn’t selfish—it’s strategic. It’s an investment in the clarity, inspiration, and flow you need to bring your vision to life.",
  "section3_heading": "Why Builders Like You Need a Retreat",
  "section3_content": "You’re not just checking boxes or crossing tasks off a list. You’re building something meaningful. Something that requires you to dig deep, think boldly, and create without compromise. But when your environment is fighting you—when the noise, clutter, and interruptions pile up—it’s nearly impossible to access the focus you need to do your best work. You don’t just need more time. You need the right space. A space where distractions disappear, and you can immerse yourself fully in the work that matters most.",
  "section4_heading": "Why the Mountains Are the Answer",
  "section4_content": "Imagine this: a quiet cabin nestled deep in the mountains. The air is crisp. The only sounds are the wind in the trees and the distant rustle of wildlife. This is a space where your mind can finally breathe. Where the weight of daily distractions fades, and you’re left with nothing but clarity, focus, and inspiration. The mountains don’t just provide an escape—they create the perfect conditions for deep work. Here, you’re not just stepping away from the noise. You’re stepping into a space designed to amplify your creativity, unlock your potential, and bring your best ideas to life.",
  "section5_heading": "Why I Built This Retreat",
  "section5_content": "Hi, I’m Craig. I’m a tech professional and an AirBnB superhost with over 300 5-star reviews. I know firsthand how hard it can be to give yourself permission to step away and focus. For years, I worked in high-pressure environments where deep work wasn’t optional—it was essential. And I learned the hard way that the right environment isn’t just helpful—it’s transformational. That’s why I built this retreat. This cabin isn’t just a place to stay. It’s a sanctuary for builders like you—creatives, entrepreneurs, and problem-solvers—who need space to think, create, and thrive.",
  "section6_heading": "Ready to Step Into Your Potential?",
  "section6_content": "Think about what’s waiting for you on the other side of the noise. The ideas you haven’t had the space to explore. The work you’ve been putting off because distractions keep getting in the way. Now imagine stepping into a space where nothing holds you back. Where silence fuels your focus. Where the mountains inspire your best work. This isn’t just a retreat. It’s your permission slip to create something extraordinary.",
