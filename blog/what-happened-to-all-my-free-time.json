  "section1_heading": "What Happened to All My Free Time?!",
  "section1_content": "I need to carve out space to get this done. Does it feel like your free time has vanished? The hours you once had to think, create, and make meaningful progress seem swallowed up by the noise, distractions, and endless demands of daily life. You’ve tried to make space, to block off time—but no matter what you do, your environment keeps taking more than it gives. And the work you care deeply about? It’s still waiting, unfinished. It’s not that you’ve lost your ambition. It’s not that you don’t care. You’re just stuck in a space that doesn’t allow you to focus, think clearly, or do your best work. You don’t just need free time—you need an environment that protects it.",
  "section2_heading": "Why Free Time Isn’t Enough",
  "section2_content": "Free time is supposed to be a gift. It’s the space where ideas can flourish, where creativity thrives, and where the work that matters most can take shape. But if your environment is full of noise, clutter, and interruptions, free time doesn’t feel free at all. Instead of progress, you find yourself scattered and frustrated. The moments you carve out for focus are stolen by distractions, leaving you feeling drained and stuck. True free time isn’t just about having hours in your day. It’s about having an environment that allows you to use those hours fully and effectively.",
  "section3_heading": "Why Builders Like You Need a Retreat",
  "section3_content": "As a builder—someone who creates, solves problems, and strives to make meaningful contributions—you’re not content with half-measures. But when your environment isn’t supporting you, even the most driven builders can’t thrive. The distractions and interruptions aren’t just frustrating—they’re barriers to the focus and flow you need to succeed. A retreat isn’t just a luxury. It’s a chance to create intentional space for the work you care about. A space where your time is truly your own, and where progress feels natural and effortless.",
  "section4_heading": "Why a Cabin in the Mountains?",
  "section4_content": "Picture this: a quiet cabin surrounded by the stillness of the mountains. No distractions. No interruptions. Just you, your thoughts, and the time you’ve been craving to focus and create. In this space, free time becomes powerful. The noise fades. The mental clutter clears. And the work that’s been waiting for your attention finally gets the focus it deserves. This isn’t just an escape. It’s a chance to reclaim your time and use it to create something extraordinary.",
  "section5_heading": "Why I Built This Retreat",
  "section5_content": "Hi, I’m Craig. I’m a tech professional and an AirBnB superhost with over 300 5-star reviews. I’ve spent years working in high-pressure environments where focus wasn’t optional—it was essential. I know how frustrating it is to feel like your time is slipping away. To have work you care about deeply but no space to focus on it. And I know how transformational it can be to step into a space where your time and energy are fully supported. That’s why I built this retreat. This isn’t just a cabin. It’s a sanctuary for builders like you—creatives, entrepreneurs, and problem-solvers—who need space to think, work, and create without interruption.",
