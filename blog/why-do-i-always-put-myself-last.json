  "section1_heading": "Why Do I Always Put Myself Last?!",
  "section1_content": "I need a retreat. You give so much. To your work, your family, your projects, your commitments—it feels like everyone and everything gets a piece of you. But when it comes to carving out time for yourself, you’re always at the bottom of the list. And yet, deep down, you know how important it is. The work that matters most to you—the creative projects, the breakthroughs, the ideas that could change everything—needs your full attention. It needs you at your best. But how can you give your best when you’re constantly running on empty? The truth is, you can’t pour from an empty cup. And it’s time to stop putting yourself last.",
  "section2_heading": "Why You Need to Come First",
  "section2_content": "As a builder—whether you’re a creator, writer, coder, musician, or entrepreneur—your work doesn’t just require time. It requires focus, clarity, and energy. But when you’re always giving to everyone else, there’s nothing left for the work that lights you up. Instead of breakthroughs, you hit blocks. Instead of progress, you feel stuck. And the frustration of knowing what you could be doing, but can’t quite reach, keeps building. To create your best work, you need more than effort. You need space. Time. And permission to put yourself first, even for just a little while.",
  "section3_heading": "Why Builders Like You Need a Retreat",
  "section3_content": "You’re not here to do just the bare minimum. You’re here to build, solve, and create things that matter. But when you’re stuck in an environment that pulls you in a hundred directions, it’s impossible to focus. You can’t give your best to your work—or yourself—when you’re constantly distracted and depleted. A retreat isn’t selfish. It’s essential. It’s a way to create the space you need to think deeply, reconnect with your work, and recharge your energy so you can give your best to everything that matters.",
  "section4_heading": "Why a Cabin in the Mountains?",
  "section4_content": "Imagine this: a quiet cabin nestled in the stillness of the mountains. No emails. No interruptions. Just the sound of the wind through the trees and the freedom to think, create, and rest in a space designed just for you. In this environment, something shifts. The noise fades. The mental clutter clears. And for the first time in a long time, you can put yourself—and your work—first. This isn’t just about escaping the chaos. It’s about stepping into an environment that helps you refocus, recharge, and reconnect with the things that matter most.",
  "section5_heading": "Why I Built This Retreat",
  "section5_content": "Hi, I’m Craig. I’m a tech professional and an AirBnB superhost with over 300 5-star reviews. I’ve spent years working in high-pressure environments where focus and flow were non-negotiable. I know how hard it is to prioritize yourself when the demands of life keep piling up. I’ve felt the frustration of being pulled in every direction except the one that leads to what truly matters. But I’ve also experienced how transformational it is to step into a space designed for focus and clarity—a space where you can finally put yourself and your work first. That’s why I built this retreat. This isn’t just a cabin. It’s a sanctuary for builders like you—creators, problem-solvers, and visionaries—who need the time and space to think deeply, work meaningfully, and recharge fully.",
  "section6_heading": "Ready to Put Yourself First?",
  "section6_content": "Think about how long you’ve been running on empty. How many ideas and projects have been delayed because you didn’t have the time or space to focus on them. How much progress is waiting for you on the other side of a clear mind and renewed energy. Now imagine stepping into a space where everything is designed to support you. A space where you can think clearly, create freely, and reconnect with what matters most. This isn’t just a retreat. It’s your chance to finally put yourself first.",
