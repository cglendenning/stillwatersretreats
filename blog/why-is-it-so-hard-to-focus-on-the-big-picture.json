  "section1_heading": "Why Is It So Hard to Focus on the Big Picture?!",
  "section1_content": "I need the space of a cabin to see it clearly. You’re ambitious. You’re driven. You’re someone who builds, creates, and dreams big. But lately, it feels impossible to step back and see the whole picture. Your mind is consumed with the little things—the never-ending details, the urgent tasks, the constant noise around you. Instead of moving forward with purpose, you’re stuck putting out fires. It’s frustrating because deep down, you know you’re capable of more. But without the space to think, plan, and prioritize, how can you create anything meaningful?",
  "section2_heading": "The Big Picture Needs Room",
  "section2_content": "Here’s the thing: the big picture doesn’t come into focus when your environment is filled with chaos. It needs room to breathe, and so do you. Clarity doesn’t just happen—it requires intentionality. A cluttered space leads to a cluttered mind, and when every moment feels like a battle to stay on track, how can you possibly connect with your vision? You need more than a few stolen minutes of quiet. You need a complete reset.",
  "section3_heading": "The Perspective to See What Truly Matters",
  "section3_content": "Imagine standing on the porch of a mountain cabin, the vast landscape stretching out before you. The stillness of the mountains creates a moment of clarity—a chance to rise above the noise and see the bigger picture of your work and your purpose. Here, the distractions that once pulled you in every direction fade into the background. Your thoughts organize, your priorities align, and the vision you’ve been chasing comes into sharp focus. It’s not about escaping; it’s about creating the space to reconnect with what’s most important. This isn’t just a retreat—it’s a reminder of why you started. In this quiet sanctuary, you’ll find the clarity, inspiration, and perspective to move forward with confidence and purpose. Are you ready to step back and see the big picture clearly again? Your mountain retreat is waiting.",
  "section4_heading": "The Space That Sparks Clarity",
  "section4_content": "Imagine this: a quiet cabin in the mountains. No buzzing phones. No endless notifications. Just you, surrounded by nature, where the silence invites reflection and the stillness allows ideas to flow. In this space, the fog begins to lift. The noise fades, and suddenly, the big picture becomes clear. You can step away from the grind, take a deep breath, and reconnect with the vision that inspired you in the first place.",
  "section5_heading": "Why I Built This Space",
  "section5_content": "My name is Craig, and I get it. I’ve been there. As a tech professional juggling ambitious projects and the constant pull of a busy world, I know what it’s like to feel stuck in the weeds. That’s why I created this retreat. I’m also an AirBnB superhost with over 300 5-star reviews, and I designed this space specifically for people like you—builders, creators, and thinkers who need a reset to do their best work. This isn’t just a place to escape; it’s a place to recalibrate, refocus, and reconnect with what matters most.",
  "section6_heading": "Your Vision Deserves This Space",
  "section6_content": "The big picture is waiting for you, but you won’t find it in the noise. You’ll find it in the stillness, the quiet, and the intentionality of stepping back. Are you ready to step into a space designed for clarity? To leave the chaos behind and rediscover your purpose?",
