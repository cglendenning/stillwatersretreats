  "section1_heading": "How Did I Let My To-Do List Spiral Out of Control?!",
  "section1_content": "I need time to catch up without distractions. Your to-do list wasn’t supposed to look like this. What started as manageable tasks and projects has grown into an overwhelming mountain of unfinished work. It stares back at you, demanding attention, and every time you try to make a dent, something pulls you away. It’s not that you don’t care. You care deeply. But your environment—the noise, the interruptions, the endless distractions—is making it impossible to focus long enough to catch up. What you need isn’t more hours in the day. What you need is time and space—real, uninterrupted time and space—to tackle your list without the constant pull of life around you.",
  "section2_heading": "Why Your To-Do List Feels Out of Control",
  "section2_content": "As a builder—whether you’re writing, coding, designing, or creating—you know the importance of focus. But in an environment filled with distractions, that focus feels impossible to achieve. Every interruption steals your momentum. Every noise breaks your concentration. And instead of progress, you’re left with a to-do list that keeps growing while your energy and motivation shrink. The truth is, you can’t fix this in the middle of chaos. To truly catch up, you need a space where the distractions disappear, and your mind can fully engage with the work that matters.",
  "section3_heading": "Why Builders Like You Need a Retreat",
  "section3_content": "You’re not just trying to check boxes. You’re trying to create, solve, and build something meaningful. But when your environment doesn’t support that vision, even the most motivated builders get stuck. The noise, the clutter, the interruptions—they’re all barriers keeping you from making progress. A retreat isn’t just a getaway. It’s an opportunity to step into an environment designed for focus, clarity, and productivity. A space where your to-do list doesn’t feel impossible, but achievable.",
  "section4_heading": "Why a Cabin in the Mountains?",
  "section4_content": "Imagine this: a cabin tucked away in the mountains, far from the noise and distractions of everyday life. There are no interruptions here. No clutter. Just the sound of nature, the stillness of the mountains, and the quiet hum of your own thoughts as you finally tackle the work that’s been waiting for your attention. In this space, your to-do list feels different. The mental clutter clears. The work that felt overwhelming becomes manageable. And you find yourself checking off tasks with a sense of ease and momentum you haven’t felt in a long time. This isn’t just about catching up. It’s about rediscovering the satisfaction and focus that comes from working in an environment that supports you.",
  "section5_heading": "Why I Built This Retreat",
  "section5_content": "Hi, I’m Craig. I’m a tech professional and an AirBnB superhost with over 300 5-star reviews. I know what it’s like to feel buried under a mountain of unfinished work, stuck in an environment that doesn’t allow you to focus. For years, I worked in high-pressure environments where distractions weren’t an option. I’ve experienced the frustration of falling behind and the transformation that comes from stepping into a space where focus and flow come naturally. That’s why I built this retreat. This isn’t just a cabin. It’s a sanctuary for builders like you—creators, entrepreneurs, and problem-solvers—who need uninterrupted time to catch up, refocus, and move forward with clarity.",

This isn’t just a retreat. It’s your reset button.",
