  "section1_content": "I need a sanctuary to reset. Do you feel like your mind is all over the place? You try to focus, but your thoughts are fragmented. You try to make progress, but every distraction pulls you in another direction. You sit down to work, and instead of clarity, you feel overwhelmed and scattered. It’s not that you’re not capable or motivated. You are. But when your environment is chaotic, noisy, or unsupportive, it becomes impossible to find the mental stillness you need to focus and create. What you need isn’t more effort or another strategy. You need a sanctuary—a quiet, supportive space where you can reset and reconnect with what matters most.",
  "section2_heading": "Why You Feel Scattered",
  "section2_content": "For builders like you—creators, writers, coders, musicians, and entrepreneurs—focus is the foundation of your best work. But focus doesn’t happen by accident. It’s cultivated in an environment that allows your mind to settle and your thoughts to align. When your environment is filled with noise, clutter, and interruptions, your mental energy is spent trying to block it all out. Instead of flow, you get friction. Instead of clarity, you get chaos. It’s not you—it’s your space. To reset, you need more than just time. You need a sanctuary that eliminates the noise, clears the distractions, and gives you the freedom to focus deeply.",
  "section3_heading": "Why Builders Like You Need a Retreat",
  "section3_content": "You’re not here to simply get through the day. You’re here to create something meaningful, solve complex problems, and make a real impact. But when your environment is working against you, even the most ambitious builders feel stuck. The noise, the interruptions, and the mental clutter aren’t just frustrating—they’re holding you back. A retreat isn’t just an escape. It’s an intentional step into a space where you can reset, recharge, and refocus. A sanctuary that helps you quiet the chaos and find the clarity to move forward.",
  "section4_heading": "Why a Cabin in the Mountains?",
  "section4_content": "Picture this: a quiet cabin surrounded by the serene stillness of the mountains. The air is fresh. The noise is gone. And for the first time in what feels like forever, your mind has room to breathe. In this space, something shifts. The distractions fade. Your thoughts align. And the mental clarity you’ve been searching for finally returns. This isn’t just about getting away—it’s about creating the conditions for your best work and your best self to emerge.",
  "section5_heading": "Why I Built This Retreat",
  "section5_content": "Hi, I’m Craig. I’m a tech professional and an AirBnB superhost with over 300 5-star reviews. I’ve spent years working in high-pressure environments where focus wasn’t just helpful—it was essential. I know how it feels to be scattered, trying to create in a space that doesn’t support you. I know the frustration of feeling stuck, knowing what you’re capable of but being unable to access it. And I know how powerful it is to step into a sanctuary that resets your mind, clears the noise, and reconnects you with your purpose. That’s why I built this retreat. This isn’t just a cabin. It’s a sanctuary for builders like you—creators, problem-solvers, and visionaries—who need a quiet, supportive space to reset and thrive.",
  "section6_heading": "Ready to Reset?",
  "section6_content": "Think about how much energy you’ve spent trying to fight the chaos around you. How many ideas have been delayed because you couldn’t focus.

It’s your chance to reset, recharge, and reconnect with your creativity and purpose.",
