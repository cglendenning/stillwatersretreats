  "section1_heading": "Why Do I Keep Jumping From Idea to Idea?!",
  "section1_content": "I need a place to organize my thoughts and focus on one. Your mind is brimming with ideas. Each one feels exciting, full of potential, and worth pursuing. But before you can bring one to life, another idea catches your attention, then another, and suddenly, you’re stuck in a loop—jumping from idea to idea without making real progress on any of them. It’s not that you lack ambition or creativity. You have plenty of both. The challenge lies in creating the mental clarity and focus needed to channel your energy into just one idea at a time. But in an environment full of distractions, that clarity feels impossible to find. What you need isn’t more time or motivation. What you need is a space to organize your thoughts, quiet the noise, and focus deeply on what matters most.",
  "section2_heading": "Why Your Focus Feels Scattered",
  "section2_content": "As a builder—whether you’re writing, coding, designing, or creating—your work depends on clarity and flow. But when your environment pulls your attention in every direction, your thoughts become fragmented. You’re left juggling ideas, unable to commit fully to one, and the progress you’re capable of making gets delayed. Focus isn’t just about discipline—it’s about creating the right environment. A space where you can slow down, organize your thoughts, and choose the idea that deserves your energy.",
  "section3_heading": "Why Builders Like You Need a Retreat",
  "section3_content": "You’re not just chasing ideas. You’re building something meaningful—something that requires your full attention and focus. But even the most creative minds can’t thrive in a chaotic, noisy environment. A retreat isn’t just an escape from the distractions. It’s an opportunity to step into a space designed to help you think deeply, organize your ideas, and focus on the work that matters most.",
  "section4_heading": "Why a Cabin in the Mountains?",
  "section4_content": "Imagine this: a quiet cabin, nestled in the mountains, far away from the demands of daily life. No buzzing notifications. No interruptions. Just the stillness of nature and the space to slow down, reflect, and refocus. In this environment, something shifts. The noise fades away. Your thoughts align. And instead of jumping from idea to idea, you find clarity and confidence in the one that matters most. This isn’t just about finding quiet—it’s about stepping into an environment that supports your creativity and focus.",
  "section5_heading": "Why I Built This Retreat",
  "section5_content": "Hi, I’m Craig. I’m a tech professional and an AirBnB superhost with over 300 5-star reviews. I’ve worked in environments where juggling multiple ideas was the norm, and I know how it feels to struggle with focus and clarity. I’ve been stuck in the loop of too many ideas, unable to choose which one to prioritize because my environment was pulling me in every direction. But I also know how transformational it is to step into a space designed for clarity—a space where you can think, organize, and create without distractions. That’s why I built this retreat. This isn’t just a cabin. It’s a sanctuary for builders like you—creators, problem-solvers, and visionaries—who need the time and space to organize their thoughts and focus deeply on one idea.",
  "section6_heading": "Ready to Find Your Focus?",
  "section6_content": "Think about how much energy you’ve spent jumping from idea to idea. How many projects have stalled because you couldn’t fully commit to one. How much potential is waiting for you on the other side of clarity and focus. Now imagine stepping into a space where the distractions disappear, and your thoughts align effortlessly. This isn’t just a retreat. It’s your chance to choose your best idea and move forward with confidence and focus.",
