  "section1_content": "I need no distractions so I can get this done. You’ve probably asked yourself this more times than you can count. You set out to tackle something deeply important—a project that lights you up, that demands your best work. But before you can even get started, the distractions close in. The noise, the interruptions, the pull of everything around you that isn’t your work. It’s not that you’re lacking motivation. If anything, you care too much. That’s why it’s so frustrating. Your ideas are there. The drive is there. But your environment is fighting you every step of the way. And until you step into a space that supports you, that work—that thing you care so much about—will stay unfinished.",
  "section2_heading": "Why Your Environment Matters",
  "section2_content": "For builders like you—creatives, coders, writers, entrepreneurs, musicians—your work isn’t something you can just pick at in short bursts. It demands focus. Flow. The kind of deep concentration that lets you solve problems, connect ideas, and create something extraordinary. But working from home makes that nearly impossible. The notifications. The laundry in the corner of your eye. The neighbor’s leaf blower. Every little thing is pulling you out of the zone. And the zone is where the magic happens. You don’t just need time to focus. You need a space that makes focus inevitable.",
  "section3_heading": "Why Builders Need a Retreat",
  "section3_content": "When your environment is full of distractions, every task feels twice as hard. You’re constantly starting, stopping, and losing momentum. But here’s the truth: it’s not you. It’s not your process. It’s the space around you. For builders like you, space isn’t just a backdrop—it’s a tool. The right environment doesn’t just remove distractions; it actively fuels your creativity, your clarity, and your ability to work at your absolute best. You don’t need to try harder. You need a space that works as hard as you do.",
  "section4_heading": "Why a Cabin in the Mountains?",
  "section4_content": "There’s a reason why the mountains are the ultimate reset for frustrated builders. Imagine stepping into a cabin surrounded by towering trees and complete stillness. No emails. No phone calls. No laundry pile staring at you from across the room. Just you, your work, and the kind of quiet that lets your mind settle and your ideas flourish. The mountains don’t just take away the noise—they replace it with clarity. In a space like this, you’re not fighting to focus. Focus happens naturally. The stillness lets you think deeply. The simplicity of the cabin clears the mental clutter. And the beauty of the mountains reminds you why you started this work in the first place. This isn’t just a break. It’s a space to finally get it done.",
