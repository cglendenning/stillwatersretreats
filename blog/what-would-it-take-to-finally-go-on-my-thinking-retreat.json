  "section1_heading": "I’m Done Thinking About It.",
  "section1_content": "I am going on my retreat. Enough is enough. You’ve tried to power through the distractions. You’ve fought against the chaos of your current environment, hoping that with enough effort, you could focus, create, and get things done. But no matter how hard you push, it’s not working. It’s not because you lack ideas, motivation, or drive. It’s because your environment is holding you back. You’re not here to settle. You’re here to build something meaningful—to create, solve problems, and bring your vision to life. And to do that, you need more than willpower. You need the right space.",
  "section2_heading": "Why It’s Time for Action",
  "section2_content": "For builders like you—creatives, coders, writers, musicians, product makers—deep work isn’t optional. It’s essential. But deep work can’t happen in an environment that’s full of noise, clutter, and constant interruptions. Those distractions don’t just slow you down—they pull you out of the flow state where your best work happens. The solution isn’t to think harder about it. It’s to act. To step into a space that’s designed for clarity, focus, and breakthroughs.",
  "section3_heading": "Why Builders Like You Need a Retreat",
  "section3_content": "You’re not just trying to get through a to-do list. You’re building something bigger than yourself. And that kind of work demands an environment that works with you—not against you. The problem is, your current space is full of competing demands. The mental clutter, the physical noise, the endless distractions—it’s all keeping you from doing your best work. What you need is more than a break. You need an intentional space where you can focus fully, think deeply, and reconnect with the work that matters most.",
  "section4_heading": "Why a Cabin in the Mountains?",
  "section4_content": "Picture this: a cabin surrounded by the stillness of the mountains. The only sound is the rustle of trees in the wind and the quiet hum of your own thoughts. In this space, the noise fades. The distractions disappear. And for the first time in what feels like forever, you have the room to focus completely on what matters. The mountains don’t just provide silence—they create clarity. Here, you’re not just escaping the chaos. You’re stepping into an environment that amplifies your creativity and focus. A space where deep work isn’t a struggle—it’s inevitable.",
  "section5_heading": "Why I Built This Retreat",
  "section5_content": "Hi, I’m Craig. I’m a tech professional and an AirBnB superhost with over 300 5-star reviews. I know exactly how important it is to get into the flow state. For years, I worked in high-pressure environments where focus wasn’t optional—it was everything. I’ve also faced the frustration of being stuck, blocked by an environment that just didn’t support me. That’s why I built this retreat. This isn’t just a cabin. It’s a sanctuary for builders like you—creators, entrepreneurs, and problem-solvers—who need space to think, work, and create without distraction.",
  "section6_heading": "Ready to Stop Thinking About It?",
  "section6_content": "You’ve tried pushing through the noise. You’ve fought against the distractions. But it’s time to stop thinking about it and take action. Imagine stepping into a space where the noise disappears. A space where focus comes naturally, and where you can finally bring your ideas to life. This isn’t just a retreat. It’s the breakthrough you’ve been waiting for.",
