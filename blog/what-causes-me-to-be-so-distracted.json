  "section1_heading": "I Am So Distracted.",
  "section1_content": "I need space to think. The constant distractions. The background noise. The never-ending interruptions that pull you away from what matters most. You’ve felt it—the frustration of trying to focus on the work you care deeply about, only to have your attention stolen by a buzzing phone, a cluttered desk, or the chaos of life around you. It’s not that you don’t have the drive or the ideas. You do. But your environment is fighting against you, turning what should be productive, meaningful work into a battle for focus. What you need isn’t just more time. What you need is space.",
  "section2_heading": "Why Space to Think Matters",
  "section2_content": "The kind of work you do—whether it’s writing, coding, designing, or creating—requires more than just hours in the day. It requires clarity. Deep focus. The ability to immerse yourself completely in your thoughts and let ideas come to life. But in a world full of noise and distractions, that kind of focus can feel impossible to achieve. Every notification, every interruption, every mental to-do adds to the clutter in your mind. It keeps you stuck in surface-level thinking, unable to dive deep into the work that truly matters. Space isn’t just about physical distance—it’s about mental freedom. And the right environment can make all the difference.",
  "section3_heading": "Why Builders Like You Need a Retreat",
  "section3_content": "As a builder—someone who creates, solves problems, and brings ideas to life—you know how much focus matters. But when your environment is chaotic, even the simplest tasks become monumental challenges. The mental load of distractions weighs you down, leaving you feeling stuck, frustrated, and far from the flow state you know you need. You don’t just need a break. You need an environment where clarity feels natural. A space where distractions disappear, and your work can take center stage.",
  "section4_heading": "Why a Cabin in the Mountains?",
  "section4_content": "Imagine this: a cabin nestled deep in the mountains. There’s no Wi-Fi buzzing, no clutter in your periphery, no background noise pulling at your attention. Just the stillness of the trees, the quiet hum of nature, and the space you’ve been craving. In this space, something incredible happens. The noise in your mind begins to settle. Your thoughts, once scattered, start to align. And the ideas that felt out of reach suddenly become clear and actionable. This isn’t just an escape—it’s a reset. A chance to step into a space that amplifies your focus and reconnects you with your creativity.",
