  "section1_heading": "How Can I Finish This Product When I’m Constantly Distracted?!",
  "section1_content": "I need solitude to ship it. You’re so close to the finish line. The idea is there, the foundation is laid, and the vision is clear. But every time you try to focus and make real progress, something pulls you away. The notifications, the noise, the endless interruptions—it’s like trying to run a marathon while carrying a hundred distractions on your back. It’s not that you’re unmotivated or lack the skills to ship your product. You have everything it takes. The problem is your environment. Right now, it’s working against you when you need it to support you the most. What you need isn’t just time to work—you need solitude. A space that clears the noise, amplifies your focus, and allows you to finish what you’ve started.",
  "section2_heading": "Why Finishing Feels Out of Reach",
  "section2_content": "For builders like you—whether you’re a coder, writer, musician, or entrepreneur—shipping isn’t just about checking a task off the list. It’s about pouring your creativity, effort, and heart into something meaningful. But shipping demands focus. And when your environment constantly distracts you, that focus is impossible to sustain. Instead of diving deep into your work, you’re stuck resetting your attention over and over again. Progress slows. Frustration grows. And the product you’re so passionate about feels like it’s slipping further away. To finish, you don’t just need more effort. You need an environment that eliminates distractions and allows you to fully engage with your work.",
  "section3_heading": "Why Builders Like You Need a Retreat",
  "section3_content": "You’re not just building a product. You’re building something that matters—something that requires deep thought, strategic focus, and uninterrupted time to create. But even the most driven builders can’t thrive in an environment that’s working against them. A retreat isn’t just a break from the noise. It’s an opportunity to step into a space that supports your focus, fuels your creativity, and gives you the solitude to finish what you’ve started.",
  "section4_heading": "Why a Cabin in the Mountains?",
  "section4_content": "Picture this: a quiet cabin, tucked away in the stillness of the mountains. No buzzing phones. No interruptions. Just the calming hum of nature and the freedom to focus completely on your product. In this space, the distractions fade. Your mind clears. Your thoughts align. And the work that once felt overwhelming starts to flow naturally, allowing you to make real, meaningful progress. This isn’t just about finding quiet—it’s about creating the perfect conditions to ship something extraordinary.",
  "section5_heading": "Why I Built This Retreat",
  "section5_content": "Hi, I’m Craig. I’m a tech professional and an AirBnB superhost with over 300 5-star reviews. I’ve spent years working in environments where focus wasn’t just helpful—it was essential. I know the frustration of being stuck in a loop of distractions when you’re trying to finish something important. I’ve felt the weight of trying to ship a product while fighting against an environment that refuses to cooperate. And I also know how transformative it is to step into a space designed for focus, clarity, and deep work. That’s why I built this retreat. This isn’t just a cabin. It’s a sanctuary for builders like you—creatives, visionaries, and problem-solvers—who need the solitude to finish their projects and ship their ideas into the world.",
