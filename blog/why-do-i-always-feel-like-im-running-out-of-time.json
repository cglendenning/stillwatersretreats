  "section1_heading": "Why Do I Always Feel Like I’m Running Out of Time?!",
  "section1_content": "I need to slow down and recalibrate. You’re racing against the clock. Every day feels like a sprint. Deadlines loom, ideas pile up, and no matter how much you accomplish, it never feels like enough. The constant rush is exhausting, and it’s stealing your ability to focus, think clearly, and create at your best. You’re not alone. When life moves this fast, it’s easy to feel like you’re always behind. But the truth is, you can’t outrun the clock. You can only recalibrate, slow down, and rediscover the clarity and focus that come from working at your own pace. What you need isn’t more time—it’s space.",
  "section2_heading": "Why Slowing Down Matters",
  "section2_content": "As a builder—whether you’re a writer, coder, musician, entrepreneur, or creator—you thrive on deep thinking and creativity. But the constant pressure to do more and go faster creates a mental fog that blocks your ability to make real progress. When you’re always rushing, you lose the ability to see the big picture. The work that matters most gets buried under a mountain of noise and stress. To create something meaningful, you need to slow down. To recalibrate, you need an environment that helps you pause, refocus, and reconnect with your purpose.",
  "section3_heading": "Why Builders Like You Need a Retreat",
  "section3_content": "You’re not just trying to keep up—you’re trying to build, create, and solve meaningful problems. But when your environment is full of distractions and chaos, it keeps you stuck in reaction mode. The rush of everyday life isn’t just stressful—it’s a barrier to progress. A retreat isn’t just a break. It’s an opportunity to step into a space that gives you permission to slow down, think deeply, and recalibrate your focus.",
  "section4_heading": "Why a Cabin in the Mountains?",
  "section4_content": "Imagine this: a quiet cabin nestled in the mountains. No deadlines. No distractions. Just the stillness of nature and the freedom to slow down, breathe, and recalibrate. In this space, time feels different. The constant rush fades. Your mind clears. And you finally have the clarity and focus to work at your own pace, without the weight of the clock hanging over you. This isn’t just about escaping—it’s about stepping into an environment that gives you the space to think, create, and move forward with purpose.",
  "section5_heading": "Why I Built This Retreat",
  "section5_content": "Hi, I’m Craig. I’m a tech professional and an AirBnB superhost with over 300 5-star reviews. I’ve spent years working in high-pressure environments where focus wasn’t optional—it was essential. I know the feeling of running out of time, of racing against the clock in an environment that only adds to the stress. And I know how transformational it can be to step away, slow down, and recalibrate in a space designed for clarity and focus. That’s why I built this retreat. This isn’t just a cabin. It’s a sanctuary for builders like you—creators, problem-solvers, and entrepreneurs—who need the time and space to slow down, think deeply, and rediscover the flow state that makes progress possible.",
  "section6_heading": "Ready to Slow Down and Recalibrate?",
  "section6_content": "Think about how much energy you’ve spent racing against time. How many ideas have been delayed because the pace was too fast to focus. How much progress is waiting for you on the other side of a clear mind and a calm environment. Now imagine stepping into a space where time feels expansive. A space where you can slow down, think deeply, and work with intention instead of urgency. This isn’t just a retreat. It’s your opportunity to take back control and move forward at your best.",
