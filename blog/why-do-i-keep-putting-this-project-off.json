  "section1_content": "I need a cabin to lock in and finally finish it. You’ve been thinking about this project for what feels like forever. It’s important to you—something you’ve dreamed about, planned for, and maybe even started. But somehow, you keep putting it off. Days turn into weeks, weeks into months, and the finish line still feels so far away. You’re not lazy, and it’s not about a lack of motivation. The problem is deeper than that: your environment isn’t supporting you. Every time you try to focus, distractions creep in, and your momentum fades. What you need is a reset. A dedicated space to lock in, eliminate distractions, and finally bring this project to life. A quiet cabin in the mountains, where the noise fades, and your focus sharpens, could be the key to crossing that finish line.",
  "section2_heading": "Why You’re Stuck",
  "section2_content": "For builders like you—creators, coders, writers, entrepreneurs, and product makers—progress happens when you can focus deeply and consistently. But when your environment is full of interruptions, clutter, or noise, it creates friction that keeps you from finding that flow state. Instead of diving into your work, you end up stuck in a cycle of procrastination and frustration. This isn’t about working harder. It’s about creating the right conditions for your work to flow naturally and effortlessly.",
  "section3_heading": "Why Builders Like You Need a Retreat",
  "section3_content": "You’re not just trying to get through a to-do list. You’re building something that matters—something that requires focus, creativity, and uninterrupted time to work deeply. But even the most ambitious builders can’t thrive in an environment that’s constantly pulling them in different directions. A retreat isn’t just about escaping the noise. It’s about stepping into a space designed to help you lock in, focus, and finish what you’ve been putting off.",
  "section4_heading": "Why a Cabin in the Mountains?",
  "section4_content": "Picture yourself in a cozy cabin surrounded by the stillness of the mountains. No buzzing notifications. No endless distractions. Just the peaceful hum of nature and the space to focus entirely on your project. In this environment, procrastination fades. Your mind clears. Your ideas align. And the work that once felt impossible starts to flow naturally, leading you closer to completion with every passing hour. This isn’t just about finding quiet—it’s about creating a space that’s perfectly suited to help you finish what you started.",
  "section5_heading": "Why I Built This Retreat",
  "section5_content": "Hi, I’m Craig. I’m a tech professional and an AirBnB superhost with over 300 5-star reviews. I’ve spent years working in high-pressure environments where focus and flow weren’t just luxuries—they were necessities. I know how frustrating it is to feel stuck, to know you’re capable of more but be unable to make progress because your environment isn’t supporting you. And I also know how transformative it is to step into a space that eliminates the noise, sharpens your focus, and allows you to immerse yourself in your work. That’s why I built this retreat. This isn’t just a cabin. It’s a sanctuary for builders like you—visionaries, problem-solvers, and creators—who need a space to focus, lock in, and finish the work that matters most.",
