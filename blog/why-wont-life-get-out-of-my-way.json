  "section1_content": "I need a retreat to unblock myself. Life has a way of piling up, doesn’t it? The constant demands, the endless distractions, the unrelenting chaos—it all feels like it’s working against you. Every time you try to focus, something else pulls you away. And the work you care about most? It’s stuck, buried under everything life throws at you. You’ve tried pushing through. You’ve tried making it work. But no matter how hard you fight, it feels like life just won’t get out of your way. What you need isn’t more effort or more willpower. What you need is a retreat. A place where the noise fades, the distractions disappear, and you can finally get unblocked.",
  "section2_heading": "Why You Feel Stuck",
  "section2_content": "As a builder—whether you’re writing, coding, creating, or designing—you know how powerful focus can be. It’s the state where everything clicks, where progress feels natural, and where ideas come to life. But in the chaos of daily life, focus feels impossible to find. Every interruption pulls you further from flow. Every distraction scatters your thoughts. And the momentum you need to create gets buried under the weight of everything competing for your attention. To get unblocked, you need more than a break. You need an environment that clears the path and allows you to focus fully on the work that matters.",
  "section3_heading": "Why Builders Like You Need a Retreat",
  "section3_content": "You’re ambitious, independent, and deeply committed to creating something meaningful. But even the most driven builders can’t thrive in an environment that works against them. The distractions, the noise, the mental clutter—they’re not just frustrating. They’re barriers keeping you from moving forward. A retreat isn’t just a luxury. It’s a tool to help you step away from the chaos and into a space where focus, clarity, and progress feel effortless.",
  "section4_heading": "Why a Cabin in the Mountains?",
  "section4_content": "Imagine this: a quiet cabin surrounded by towering trees and open skies. No noise. No interruptions. Just the stillness of the mountains and the time and space you need to think clearly and create freely. In this environment, the mental clutter disappears. Your thoughts align. The work that’s been stuck begins to flow. And the ideas that once felt out of reach come rushing back with clarity and purpose. This isn’t just an escape. It’s an intentional step into the environment you need to unlock your best work.",
  "section5_heading": "Why I Built This Retreat",
  "section5_content": "Hi, I’m Craig. I’m a tech professional and an AirBnB superhost with over 300 5-star reviews. I’ve spent years working in high-pressure environments where focus wasn’t just helpful—it was essential. I know how it feels to be blocked, stuck in an environment that doesn’t support you. I know the frustration of fighting distractions, noise, and mental clutter that keeps you from creating. And I know how transformational it can be to step into a space designed for focus and flow. That’s why I built this retreat. This isn’t just a cabin. It’s a sanctuary for builders like you—creatives, entrepreneurs, and problem-solvers—who need a space to get unblocked and rediscover their momentum.",
